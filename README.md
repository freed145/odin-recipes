Self-Reflection:
This was an interesting project for me. It show cases my ability to create different pages and adequately manage the websites file structure. Pages are linked from the index, and include different headings, paragraphs, images, and lists. One page includes nested lists. I found that once the initial recipe page was created it was much easier to create the subsequent two by reusing the general structure of that initial recipe page. Pages were created via with the CLI with either touch, mv, or cp commands. While the site itself looks very basic, I'm proud of the result and look forward to learning ways to enhance it visually.
