Self-Reflection:
This was an interesting project for me. It show cases my ability to create different pages and adequately manage the websites file structure. Pages are linked from the index, and include different headings, paragraphs, images, and lists. One page includes nested lists. I found that once the initial recipe page was created it was much easier to create the subsequent two by reusing the general structure of that initial recipe page. Pages were created via with the CLI with either touch, mv, or cp commands. While the site itself looks very basic, I'm proud of the result and look forward to learning ways to enhance it visually.

Added basic CSS elements such as different font, colors, and centered images.

Redesign to spruce up the site visually. Took out unnecessary ingredient information on recipe pages. Added link to AllRecipes. Will need to update in the future to make more mobile friendly, as the site currently loads at a fixed 800px. I tried using max-width but this pushes the description text to the next line when window is shrunk. This requires further research.
